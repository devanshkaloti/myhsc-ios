# About
MySchool Day Planner is the one stop solution to all your needs and problems. With this app, you can manage your day courses through the schedule feature. You can also keep track of your assignments for the complete month! 

If you've started a week-long project, swipe left to mark it as In Progress. Then once you're done, you can swipe again to mark it as done. Is there an assignment you don't feel like doing? Well - just swipe right to snooze it and the app will automatically remind you later. 

You can also use the marks calculator to get your weighted average on an assignment or test. The app also keeps track of your older assignments in case you want to check your course average before they're released. 

Also, you can read your college-wide announcements or see the class planner right from your dashboard. 

The app also features your weekly lunch menu
